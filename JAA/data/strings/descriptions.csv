jaa_pike,WEAPON,"An anti-shield missile intended for use at medium and long ranges of engagement, it utilises a ""charged disruptor-alloy"" warhead with relatively mediocre punching power against solid objects but can deliver devestating damage to shields
 
Development on this weapon was abandoned by the Domain, but was later continued in secret by the Hegemony which, owing to a paucity of hulls capable of fielding the weapon, chose to kept the weapon classified. In of COMSEC's most embarrassing failures, the blueprints were subsequently stolen by Pirates, and the weapon has since found itself in use by The Sindrian Diktat and Tri-Tachyon",,,
jaa_chemlaser,WEAPON,"A mid size laser powered by a chemical reaction giving it the anti-armor characteristics of the high intensity laser. 

Developed by the Diktat and sold to the League for crucial scientific knowledge, it is mainly intended for use on cruisers such as the Eagle or the Falcon which can supplement it with ballistic weapons to bring down the shields of their enemies",,,
jaa_crossbowlrm,WEAPON,"A Long-Range-Missile. while producing far less emp than the Pilum, it's damage is considerably higher. It is also slightly faster on the approach and the firing at range makes it considerably less vulnerable to small point-defense systems.

Cooked up by rogue scientists in the employ of Kanta. It utilizes parts and subsystems out of the data banks of Kanta's den and out of data hashes in the treasures of warlord Loke. Through the many skirmishes in the Magec the Tri-Tachyon corporation and the Independent microfactions of the sector have also gained access to this weapon.",,,
jaa_plague,SHIP,"Heavy anti small craft support and escort craft. Mounting the Grasshopper SRM it can rip apart enemy fighters and even frigates when massed. At the same time, it lacks operational range, requires a considerable crew complement and is not very survivable for it's size

A post-collapse design of the Church of Galactic Redemption, it is the opposite of miniaturized and automated. It has still proven a effective escort for the capital ships of both the Knights of Ludds and the Luddic path",,,
jaa_grasshopper,WEAPON,"A Derivative of the Locust SRM, the Grasshopper SRM fires 16 missiles in a salvo, as opposed to the Locust's 40. While it doesn't invoke quite the same terror in fighter pilots as it's larger brother, it still commands considerable respect among them. 

A post-collapse design of the Luddic church, the Grasshopper SRM found, of course, it's way into the hands of the Luddic path, though a lack of suitable hulls has made it's deployment by them sparse, to the relief of the sectors fighter pilots",,,
jaa_stormwind,SHIP,"An agile fighter equipped with a modified needler firing shorter bursts than it's standard counterpart. Struggles to secure kills on its own but can exert considerable pressure on an enemy.

A Persean League design, the Stormwind utilizes the latest advancements in small-scale generator technology and modular design. As a result of this, it can be deployed in high numbers and swiftly replaced when a unit is destroyed, all while remaining surprisingly survivable.",,,
jaa_gdisruptor,WEAPON,"Projectile firing kinetic energy weapon. Large version of the gravitonic disruptor. Slightly longer range and more efficient.

Many high officers and executives in the Tri-Tachyon coopertion and it's military forces opposed the developement of the gravitonic disruptor due to fears that, if aquired by them, it's enemies would deal far more damage than the cooperation would gain from the weapon. The Multidisruptor had even heavier opposition due to a lack of models that could use it. It was nonetheless pushed through by an amitious executive with support from a accomplished admiral of the second AI war.",,,
jaa_gdisruptorM,WEAPON,"Projectile firing kinetic energy weapon. Close range but quite strong on fast ships. 

Developed by Tri-Tachyon to increase the shieldbreaking power of it's fast cruisers and destroyers, this weapon utilizes technologies found in the ion pulser and the gravitonic beam. It's short range gravity anomalies can quickly compromise the shields of the enemy in a close attack run, but after creating the opening they struggle in exploiting them.",,,
jaa_Kshotgun,WEAPON,"Kinetic multi projectile weapon with a large spread, but very high dps and efficiency.

The KS1 Magno-scatter is based upon a design considered obsolete by the domain navy long before the collapse, and left to languish until it was discovered in obscure leftover data in the storage banks of the fourtheenth battlegroup. The engineers of the Hegemony redesigned the weapons caseless ammunition and so managed to create a fearsome close-range weapon.",,,
jaa_Eshotgun,WEAPON,"Close range proximity-fused multi projectile weapon with large spread, but very high dps and efficiency

The ES3 is the result of several experiments conducted to ascertain whether or not the large spread of the KS1 could be utilized for proximity-fused ammunition to create a lethal blanket of point defense fire. It can also be utilized as a lethal close range weapon against small ships, whereas it's large spread makes it unattractive to larger ships. ",,,
jaa_lneedlerhalf,WEAPON,A modified verion of the light needler built to fire shorter bursts more often and over shorther distances. Same effective output as a normal light needler,,,
jaa_grasshopper_ftr,WEAPON,"a fighter version of the Grasshopper SRM, carrying less ammuntion",,,
